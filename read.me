This is a work in progress game with the goal of creating a game that closely mimics the mechanics of the 2008 game designed by Sid Meier, Civilization Revolution.

What is currently inclded in this repository is base that constructs the isometric, scalable map with random terrain generation, basic resource managment system with
building placement that produce resources for the player to use, and a basic implementation of worker units.


Credits to https://github.com/scartwright91/city_builder_tutorial for the base of this game. The tutorial provided a great stepping stone towards 
the end goal of a recreation of the game Civilization Revolution
